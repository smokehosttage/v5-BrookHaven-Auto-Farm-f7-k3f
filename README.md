3. **Extract the Files** 📦  
   After downloading, locate the ZIP file in your Downloads folder. Right-click it and select "Extract All." Choose a safe directory like C:\RobloxScripts (create it if it doesn't exist). Use emojis to label your folders for fun – like renaming it to "🎮BrookHaven🎮". Windows 2025's built-in extractor is super fast! ⚡

4. **Run the Script Safely** 🚨  
   Navigate to the extracted folder. Look for the main executable file (usually named something like "BrookHaven.exe"). Right-click it, select "Run as administrator," and follow any on-screen prompts. If you're on Windows 2025, enable "Developer Mode" in Settings for smoother execution. Always scan files with Windows Defender first! 🛡️

5. **Integrate with Roblox** 🔗  
   Launch Roblox from your desktop or the Microsoft Store. Join a BrookHaven game server. Open the script's interface (it might auto-load or require a hotkey like F9). Customize settings like speed boosts or visual enhancements – all tailored for 2025's high-res graphics. Test it in a private server to avoid any issues. 🌍

6. **Troubleshooting Common Issues** ⚠️  
   - **Error Messages:** If you see errors, check your Windows version in System Information (search for it in the Start menu). Ensure it's 2025-compliant.  
   - **Performance Lags:** Update your graphics drivers via Device Manager. In 2025, NVIDIA or AMD tools integrate seamlessly with Windows for auto-updates. 🎨  
   - **Script Not Loading:** Verify internet stability – Roblox requires a stable connection. Try disabling antivirus temporarily (but turn it back on after!). 🔗  
   - **Account Safety:** Always log out and clear cache if something feels off. Use Roblox's 2025 two-factor authentication for extra protection. 🛡️
